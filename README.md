# BioAcoustics-Plant-Sounds-Classification

Detecting plant conditions through emission of ultrasonic sounds is a difficult challenge. Traditional approaches typically rely on physical observations or outward signs, which arenâ€™t always effective for early detection. This research introduces a new method that uses deep learning to first determine whether these ultrasonic sounds from plants contain useful information. After identifying relevant sounds, a model is trained to recognize different plant types and their stress conditions based on these sounds. Since these high-frequency sounds are inaudible to the human ear, they are recorded in controlled environments like greenhouses. This method offers a non-invasive, automated system for monitoring plant health. By classifying the sounds into categories that reflect stress or damage, farmers can quickly take action to improve crop conditions. This approach has the potential to significantly enhance productivity by enabling early and precise intervention in plant care.
